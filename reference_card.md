# INVEST Quality Quick Reference Card

## Common Story Problems & Quick Fixes

### 🚨 Critical Issues (Fix First)
| Problem | Example | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Vague User** | "As a user..." | "As a customer service rep..." |
| **Solution-Focused** | "I want a dropdown menu..." | "I want to select my location..." |
| **Missing Benefit** | "I want to update my profile" | "...so I receive relevant notifications" |
| **Untestable Criteria** | "System is user-friendly" | "User completes task in <3 clicks" |

### ⚠️ Advisory Improvements
| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| **Too Many ACs** | Split into multiple stories |
| **Implementation Details** | Focus on user outcomes, not how |
| **Multiple User Types** | One story per user role |
| **Nice-to-Have Language** | Add business justification |

### ✅ Signs of a Good Story

- [ ] Clear goal focused on user outcome

- [ ] 3-8 testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Fits in one sprint
